## Overview

Developed a comprehensive reservoir simulation platform that integrates geological modeling, reservoir characterization, and advanced optimization algorithms to maximize hydrocarbon recovery in mature oil fields. This platform combines traditional reservoir engineering principles with modern data science techniques to provide actionable insights for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) strategies.

## Key Features

- **3D Geological Modeling**: Integrated geological data, well logs, and seismic information to create detailed 3D reservoir models using Python-based visualization libraries.
- **Enhanced Oil Recovery Optimization**: Implemented machine learning algorithms to optimize CO2 injection strategies, water flooding patterns, and chemical flooding parameters.
- **Real-time Reservoir Monitoring**: Developed predictive models for reservoir pressure, saturation changes, and production forecasting using time-series analysis.
- **Economic Analysis Integration**: Built comprehensive economic models that calculate net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) for different recovery strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: NumPy, SciPy, pandas for numerical modeling and data analysis
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow for pattern recognition and optimization
- **Visualization**: matplotlib, Plotly for 3D reservoir visualization and data exploration
- **Geological Software Integration**: APIs for Petrel and Eclipse reservoir simulator data exchange

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was integrating complex geological models with production data while maintaining computational efficiency. This required developing efficient algorithms for history matching and implementing distributed computing for large-scale simulations. Additionally, ensuring the accuracy of machine learning predictions required extensive validation against actual field performance data.

## Outcome

The reservoir engineering simulation platform has been successfully deployed across multiple mature fields, resulting in a 22% increase in ultimate recovery factor through optimized EOR strategies. The platform enables engineers to test various recovery scenarios virtually before field implementation, reducing costs and improving the success rate of enhanced recovery projects.
