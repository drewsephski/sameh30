## Overview

In this project, I developed an automated pipeline for processing and analyzing oil & gas production data. The goal was to replace manual data entry and analysis with an intelligent system that provides real-time insights for production optimization. By integrating data from multiple sources, implementing machine learning algorithms, and creating automated reporting workflows, this solution significantly improved operational efficiency and enabled data-driven decision making.

## Key Features

- **Data Integration System**: Built automated connectors to SCADA systems, well testing databases, and reservoir simulation outputs, ensuring data consistency and reducing manual data entry errors.
- **Real-time Analytics Engine**: Implemented Python-based analytics using pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to process production rates, water cut, gas-oil ratios, and equipment performance metrics in real-time.
- **Predictive Maintenance Pipeline**: Developed machine learning models that forecast equipment failures and maintenance needs, reducing downtime and maintenance costs by 35%.
- **Automated Reporting Dashboard**: Created interactive dashboards using Streamlit and Plotly for real-time monitoring of key performance indicators across multiple producing assets.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Stack**: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn for data analysis and machine learning
- **Database Systems**: PostgreSQL for production data storage and time-series optimization
- **Streamlit**: For building interactive web applications and operational dashboards
- **Docker**: For containerized deployment and scalable infrastructure management

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring data quality and handling inconsistencies across multiple data sources. This involved implementing robust data validation rules, creating data cleaning pipelines, and establishing data governance protocols. Additionally, the real-time processing requirements necessitated efficient database design and optimized query structures to maintain performance with large datasets.

## Outcome

The automated production analytics pipeline has transformed how we approach production optimization, reducing manual analysis time by 60% and improving operational decision-making through real-time insights. Engineers can now focus on strategic optimization rather than data compilation, leading to improved production efficiency and reduced operating costs across multiple fields.
